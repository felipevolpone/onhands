### Disclaimer
This is an *experimental* project! I wrote it because I would like to have the
experience of writing a framework. Ray helped me to think how to create better
abstractions, how to write code that other developers would use to write their
web apps and so on. Is also important to say that this project does not intend
to replace Django, Flask or Bottle. As I said I wrote it as a coding exercise.
With all that said, you're welcome to contribute to it if you want to have the
same experience, but you are also aware that this project may not be
production-ready.
